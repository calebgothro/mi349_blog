            <h3>Cade Cunningham is a SUPERSTAR</h3>
            <address class="author">Caleb Gothro</address>

            <p>After a rough couple of seasons, Cade Cunningham has finally entered into the elite, top 15 player, superstar conversations that his believers always knew he could. This past season, the Pistons won 44 games, more than the previous two seasons combined and triple their previous season's total, a first in NBA history. This turnaround put Cade and the Pistons in the spotlight this season, and has made many excited for the future in Detroit.</p>

            <p>During Cade's first three seasons, despite being a highly touted first overall pick coming into the league, the Pistons couldn't find any success, winning less than 25 games in each season. They hit rock bottom in his third season, when they won a franchise worst 14 games and had an NBA record 28 game losing streak. The main reason for these struggles was the roster construction, with management failing to put any competent shooters or veterans around their young players, which caused Cade and the rest of the Piston's young core to have to play their first few years in the league without any spacing. However, after a top down change in management, the Pistons picked up multiple floor spacing veterans, and the impact on Cade's game is undeniable. Just look at his stats each season throughout his career:</p>

                    <td>9.1</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>The minute Cade had a competent team around him, he went from decent scoring on terrible efficiency to high volume scoring on very solid efficiency. The fact that he has already improved this much under the new management, has already led the Pistons back to the playoffs, and is still only 23 years old is incredibly exciting, and I can't wait to see where he takes this team as he continues to ascend.</p>

            <h3>Can Ausar become the Piston's Second Option?</h3>
            <address class="author">Caleb Gothro</address>
            <time datetime="2025-06-08">June 8th, 2025</time>
            <p>If we learned anything from the Piston's first playoff series in over five years, it’s that Cade Cunningham needs serious help, specifically from a reliable offensive second option. While many fans this offseason have been hoping for a big trade, throwing out names like Derrick White, Jaren Jackson Jr., Devin Booker, and even Giannis, it is much more likely that the front office opts to keep their young core going in to this next season to see if any of the young players can grow into that necessary offensive help. One player who could potentially make a leap into being that secondary ball handler of the future is Ausar Thompson, and there are a few specific areas of growth to look for next season to see if he is on his way there.</p>

            <p>Ausar was either the second or third most impactful Piston last season, and you could make the argument that his truly elite perimeter defense was the main difference maker when the Pistons hit another level around January of this year. Defense, game-breaking athleticism, rebounding, and basketball IQ are practically guaranteed from him at this point. In order to take the steps to become the Piston’s second star, Ausar would need to seriously refine his offensive game, greatly improving his jumpshot, and becoming a much more controlled ball handler. There have been flashes of solid creation, but he is a long way from being a volume creator at this point. For next season, if he can use his playmaking feel as an initiator as well as a connector, and can show signs of improved shooting, he could potentially be on his way to being the ballhandling help that Cade needs.</p>
