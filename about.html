    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <p><img alt="Headshot of Caleb Gothro" src=Images/Headshot2024.jpg></p>
    <p>Hi, my name is Caleb Gothro! I am 21 years old and a recent MSU graduate. At MSU, I majored in information science with a focus on human centered technology. I also found a passion for community engagement, and was able to gain valuable experience in organizational development as the co-founder of START (Students Teaming for Advocacy and Recovery Together), a student organization focused on hosting events to change the culture around substance use and to encourage students to take advantage of the resources available to them. Long term, I would love to be a program manager for community based organizations and continue to make as much of an impact as I can.</p>
    <p>My Pistons fandom started in 2021, when the Pistons won the NBA Draft Lottery and drafted Cade Cunningham. Unfortunately, the pistons were one of the worst teams in the league the next few seasons, and I was a witness to some of this franchise’s darkest times. However, I never gave up hope, and was always excited to watch the young players figure out how to play in the NBA, even if it didn’t lead to winning. This changed last year, after the franchise did a complete management overhaul, they were much, MUCH better this past season and had one of the best single season turnarounds in NBA history. Now I’m just excited to see where the Pistons can take this momentum over the next few seasons, and am excited to produce content about it to be a part of the rich community.</p>
