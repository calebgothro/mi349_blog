            <p>Hi, I'm Caleb Gothro, a 21-year-old recent MSU graduate with a degree in information science focused on human-centered technology. I'm passionate about community engagement and co-founded START, a student org that hosts events promoting healthy substance use culture and resource awareness. Long term, I hope to be a program manager for community-based organizations and make a meaningful impact.</p>

            <p>My Pistons fandom started in 2021, when the Pistons won the NBA Draft Lottery and drafted Cade Cunningham. Unfortunately, the pistons were one of the worst teams in the league the next few seasons, and I was a witness to some of this franchise’s darkest times. However, I never gave up hope, and was always excited to watch the young players figure out how to play in the NBA, even if it didn’t lead to winning. This changed last year, after the franchise did a complete management overhaul, they were much, MUCH better this past season and had one of the best single season turnarounds in NBA history. Now I’m just excited to see where the Pistons can take this momentum over the next few seasons, and am excited to produce content about it to be a part of the rich community.</p>
